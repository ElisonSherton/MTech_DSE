This public repo contains resources for all the courses covered under MTech Data Science and Engineering course offered by BITS-Pilani.

Resources include instructor slides, open-source books, supplementary content and the like. Following is the list of courses which I had opted for across the three semesters

|Semester|Course Name|Type|Credits|
|--|--|--|--|
|Sem1|Computer Organization and Software Systems|Compulsory|5|
|Sem1|Data Mining|Compulsory|3|
|Sem1|Data Structures and Algorithm Design|Compulsory|5|
|Sem1|Mathematical Foundation for Data Science|Compulsory|4|
|Sem2|Machine Learning|Compulsory|4|
|Sem2|Introduction to Statistical Methods|Compulsory|3|
|Sem2|Introduction to Data Science|Compulsory|3|
|Sem2|Systems for Data Analytics|Elective|5|
|Sem3|Deep Learning|Compulsory|4|
|Sem3|Stream Processing & Analytics|Elective|5|
|Sem3|Big Data Systems|Elective|5|
|Sem3|Probabilistic Graphical Methods|Elective|4|

The course also required us to complete a set of challenging assignments for each semester. Some of them were group assignments and some were individual assignments. A list of the assignments solved by me along with the questions are mentioned as follows. 

I only wish these to be referred to as a guiding principle and not by any ways as the model solution or only solution. It is really important to choose your group members wisely as some of these assignments are really intricate and require substantial amount of your time and effort. I want to thank few of my fellow members [Shreysi Kalra](https://github.com/shreyasi25), [Ajith Praveen R](https://github.com/ElisonSherton/DL_SPA_Assignments/tree/main) and [Sai Prabhanjan Reddy](https://github.com/prabhanjan215) for their time and contribution in these assignments.
